## üö® Critical Issues & Missing Components

### 1. **Inventory Management** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
```typescript
// Current: Basic stock field exists but no inventory logic
stock: integer("stock").default(0)
```
**Issues:**
- No automatic stock reduction on purchase
- No low stock alerts
- No inventory tracking across orders
- No stock reservation during checkout process

**Required:**
- Implement stock reduction in webhook handlers
- Add stock validation before checkout
- Create inventory alerts system
- Add stock history tracking

### 2. **Order Fulfillment & Logistics** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Missing:**
- Order status workflow (processing ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí delivered)
- Shipping integration (tracking numbers, carriers)
- Vendor notification system for new orders
- Automated order routing to vendors
- Return/refund management system

### 3. **Financial Management** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Missing:**
- Commission/fee calculation for vendors
- Payout system for vendors
- Tax calculation and reporting
- Financial reporting and analytics
- Multi-currency support (though MXN is handled)

### 4. **Security & Compliance** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Issues:**
- No input sanitization visible in product creation
- Missing rate limiting on API endpoints
- No comprehensive error handling in payment flows
- Missing GDPR/privacy compliance features
- No audit logging system

### 5. **Performance & Scalability** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Issues:**
- No caching strategy implemented
- No CDN integration for product images
- No database query optimization
- No image optimization beyond Next.js defaults
- No search indexing (using basic SQL queries)

## üîß Specific Technical Gaps

### 1. **Incomplete Webhook Implementation**
```typescript
// Current webhook is basic - missing critical functionality
case "checkout.session.completed": {
  // TODO: Send order confirmation email
  // Missing: Stock reduction, vendor notifications
}
```

### 2. **Cart Context Issues**
```typescript
// Cart state is client-side only - will lose data on refresh
const [state, setState] = useState<CartState>({
  items: [],
  isOpen: false,
});
```
**Needs:** Server-side cart persistence for logged-in users

### 3. **Missing Business Logic**
- No product availability checks during checkout
- No automatic order splitting by vendor
- No shipping cost calculation based on location/weight
- No discount/coupon system
- No loyalty program features

### 4. **Incomplete Admin Features**
- Basic CRUD operations only
- No comprehensive analytics dashboard
- No bulk operations for products
- No automated reporting
- No fraud detection/monitoring
